# ElevatorGame
Elevators is a project that dabbles in Game Design, Artificial Intelligence, and designing real-world systems. Using C++, I have created a complete implementation for a game in which the player operates 3 elevators in a busy building, making decisions and servicing requests to keep the people inside the building as happy as possible.
